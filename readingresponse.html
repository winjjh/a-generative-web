        Week 02: As individuals start making websites by hand, that is, by
        coding themselves, the height of the web design perspective is
        proportional to the time invested in the Internet In web design, basic
        technologies such as html are literally basic. In order to increase
        added value, it is expected in what direction and how a handmade and
        visualized website will come out in the future.

        Week 03: After modernism, outdated values ​​such as the future, art, and
        novelty have been weathered and diluted through various streams and have
        become objects of intentional avoidance and rejection in the present.
        Technology and art, politics and culture, journalism and advertising
        culture, web coding and web design...are the categories and values
        ​​that move dizzyingly between them finding reconciliation and staying
        in one place in the principality? Rather than the reconciling
        recombination of existing traditional values ​​and categories, these
        phenomena undergo a process of fundamental deconstruction and
        recombination. Maybe Unicode is something like that. The fragmented and
        deconstructed traditional codes are recombined into contemporary codes.
        The recombination of this code is not done above but by the recipients
        below. These fragmented codes will be located spatially, i.e. on the
        Web.

        Week 04: The content is very concise, sometimes poetic, absurd, and out
        of context. However, in the process, it is a book that gives the reader
        a chance to imagine or attain enlightenment according to the
        individual's abilities. Personally, although the content is different,
        Buddhist Zen questions and answers come to mind, and sometimes I feel a
        blank space.

        Week 05: Concept design games represent the theory of design. By playing
        them back, the theory is likely to be tested and, consequently,
        modified. Actually playing those games is a way to learn about design,
        but you can learn a lot more by making your own games. Decisions about
        the form of space - having a strong and inevitable social dimension,
        were influenced by the way the parties involved interacted. And I think
        this phenomenon can also be seen in web construction. The game itself
        only focuses on certain aspects of the overall experience of the design.
        The interaction between the player and the game can also be applied in
        the digital world.

        Week 06: Unlike the past, digital is starting to be reconstituted as a
        new alternative space. The images that digital wants to represent are
        placed on the web, and the condensed set of images on the one hand
        neutralizes the text function in digital. The creation and reading of
        digital images is made up of the grammar of the image language, and we
        think that we should consider not only the images and designs shown on
        the web, but also the logic, input, and the process to achieve them to
        be shown in the media.

        Week 07: The innovation of media art, that is, computer art, has a long
        history. Human technology is emerging with new diversity today. Modern
        media art is constantly undergoing self-transformation along with its
        diversity. In this article, we explore how the art of the past has
        developed from the past to the present, and trace the footsteps of media
        technology. The history of computer art can be a major prelude to
        equipping us with the senses and thoughts to respond to the creation and
        deconstruction of our cubist reality living in the age of speed.

        Week 08: It has the advantage of being able to easily trade works with
        unique artistic value, but above all else, the NFT market is growing
        rapidly as it is also working with expectations that it can achieve high
        profits like virtual currency in an emerging market. In the art world,
        NFTs are also evaluated to have certain advantages in that they solve
        problems that have been difficult to be easily known or distributed even
        though each art work has its own unique charm, and that it can more
        reliably guarantee value by combining it with technology. However, there
        are also a number of concerns that it may be misused to distort the
        market with bubbled prices and launder black money. Just as the adoption
        and craze of blockchain is driven primarily by people's gossip on
        Twitter and Telegram, the value of an artwork is determined by the
        ongoing debates and conversations in the art market.

        Week 09: The five main characteristics of a computer are large capacity:
        processing and storing a large amount of data, versatility: using a
        computer for various purposes, compatibility: one hardware or software
        can be used on multiple computers regardless of computer type, accuracy:
        The degree to which the function required by the user is satisfied,
        reliability: It seems to be the degree to smoothly perform the function
        in charge without any failure in a given environment.

        Week 10: Software culture is an unfamiliar concept, but forms such as
        the open source movement are also part of the culture. Various contents
        are created by developing software and mediating the developed software.
        If everything that human beings are involved in is a cultural product,
        it is understandable that the lifestyle intensive in coding is software
        culture. Giving meaning and value of software as a socio-cultural entity
        by re-adjusting the industrial frame of looking at software has another
        meaning. In other words, it can be set as the goal of a
        software-oriented society. As a culture, software will be properly
        evaluated for its technological value as well as its socio-cultural
        value through the harmony between perception and reality. Through this
        value evaluation, software is expected to play its role from a
        technology-oriented medium to a culture-oriented medium.

        Week 11: It has the advantage of being able to easily trade works with
        unique artistic value, but above all else, the NFT market is growing
        rapidly as it is also working with expectations that it can achieve high
        profits like virtual currency in an emerging market. In the art world,
        NFTs are also evaluated to have certain advantages in that they solve
        problems that have been difficult to be easily known or distributed even
        though each art work has its own unique charm, and that it can more

        are also a number of concerns that it may be misused to distort the

        Week 12 + 13: Any business that seeks to streamline processes and
        transition to more efficient models will encounter automation, machine
        learning and artificial intelligence (AI) along the way. Today, we are
        still engaged in numerous repetitive labor activities, but advances in
        AI technology are helping to reduce these inefficiencies. It helps
        reduce repetitive tasks and makes business more efficient. If you
        compare it to a pyramid, AI is the technology at the top of the pyramid.
        However, just as a pyramid cannot float in the air, AI also requires a
        variety of underlying technologies to implement it. It can be mistaken
        for AI and automation to be the same thing. However, automation is not
        necessarily accompanied by AI. In fact, automation has been the way we
        work for centuries, even before the advent of computers. A mill using a
        traditional watermill is an early example of automation. Simple
        automation has been the cornerstone of many businesses over the years.
        Automation refers to the way machines replicate human tasks. On the
        other hand, AI requires machines to replicate human thinking. This
        refers to a program that can make decisions on its own when it goes
        beyond the scope of its own programming in performing a specific work
        process. For the time being, AI will only occupy a niche in the entire
        industry landscape, and automation will remain mainstream in most areas
        of business. But ultimately, easier machine learning capabilities could
        allow AI to act as a safeguard in automated procedures. It is the role
        of the supervisor (AI), not the worker (automation).

        Week 14: With the development of science in the 21st century, the
        existing boundaries between art and technology are breaking down. We are
        realizing convergence emphasizing two-way communication. The aesthetic
        experience of spatial design presented in a playful space of art and
        technology should not be overlooked either. In the playful space of art
        and technology, Expression using art and technology is activated by the
        stimulation of emotional experience. A new aesthetic experience. In
        modern times, a new environment is being created by the fusion of art
        and art. Stimulates the imagination of technology and art. In addition,
        in a new space surrounded by technology, the meaning of human
        sensibility and consciousness has been newly defined.
